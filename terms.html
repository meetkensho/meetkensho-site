    <br/> YOU AGREE TO INDEMNIFY KENSHO FOR ANY LOSS, DAMAGE, COST OR EXPENSE THAT KENSHO MAY SUFFER OR INCUR AS A RESULT OF OR
    IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE OF OR CONDUCT IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE AND/OR ITEM, INCLUDING ANY BREACH BY YOU OF
    THIS AGREEMENT.
    <br/>
    <br/> IN NO CASE SHALL KENSHO, OUR DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AFFILIATES, AGENTS, CONTRACTORS, INTERNS, SUPPLIERS, SERVICE
    PROVIDERS OR LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY INJURY, LOSS, CLAIM, OR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, SPECIAL,
    OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS, LOST REVENUE, LOST SAVINGS, LOSS OF
    DATA, REPLACEMENT COSTS, OR ANY SIMILAR DAMAGES, WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY
    OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM YOUR USE OF ANY OF THE SERVICE OR ANY PRODUCTS PROCURED USING THE SERVICE, OR FOR ANY OTHER
    CLAIM RELATED IN ANY WAY TO YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE OR ANY PRODUCT, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY ERRORS OR OMISSIONS
    IN ANY CONTENT, OR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE OF ANY KIND INCURRED AS A RESULT OF THE USE OF THE SERVICE OR ANY CONTENT (OR PRODUCT)
    POSTED, TRANSMITTED, OR OTHERWISE MADE AVAILABLE VIA THE SERVICE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THEIR POSSIBILITY. BECAUSE SOME
    STATES OR JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES,
    IN SUCH STATES OR JURISDICTIONS, OUR LIABILITY SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.
    <br/>
    <br/> TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, KENSHO’S LIABILITY FOR BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT OR OTHERWISE IN CONNECTION WITH THE
    SERVICE OR THE PROJECT, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OR CONDITION THAT CANNOT BE EXCLUDED, IS RESTRICTED AT KENSHO’S
    OPTION TO THE RE-SUPPLY OF SERVICE, OR PAYMENT OF THE COST OF RE-SUPPLY OF SERVICE (IF APPLICABLE).
    <br/>
    <br/> 16. Release
    <br/>
    <br/> As an inducement to Kensho permitting you to access and use the Service, you hereby agree to release Kensho, and its
    affiliates and subsidiaries, and each of its and their respective officers, directors, agents, partners, and Workers
    from all damages (whether direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, or otherwise), losses, liabilities, costs, and
    expenses of every kind and nature, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with disputes between you
    and third parties (including other Users) in connection with the Service. In addition, you waive any applicable law or
    statute, which says, in substance:
    <br/>
    <br/> “A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE RELEASING PARTY DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS FAVOR
    AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS SETTLEMENT WITH THE RELEASED
    PARTY."
    <br/>
    <br/> 17. Attorneys’ fees
    <br/>
    <br/> In the event that either Party breaches any portion of this Agreement, the prevailing Party in an action to enforce
    this Agreement may recover from the other its reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs, if employment of an attorney was
    necessary.
    <br/>
    <br/> 18. Notices
    <br/>
    <br/> The User can direct notices, enquiries, complaints and so forth to Kensho at this address:
    <br/> help@kensho.com
    <br/> A consent, notice or communication under this Agreement is effective if it is sent as an electronic communication unless
    required to be physically delivered under law. You consent to receive electronic communications and you agree that all
    agreements, notices, disclosures and other communications that we provide to you electronically, via email and on the
    Site, satisfy any legal requirement that such communications be in writing.
    <br/>
    <br/> 19. Disputes
    <br/>
    <br/> If you’re upset with us, let us know, and hopefully we can resolve your issue. But if we can’t, then these rules will
    govern any legal dispute involving our Service:
    <br/>
    <br/> Governing Law. The Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to its conflict of laws rules,
    and the laws of the United States of America. These laws will apply no matter where in the world you live, but if you
    live outside of the United States, you may be entitled to the protection of the mandatory consumer protection provisions
    of your local consumer protection law.
    <br/>
    <br/> Arbitration. You and Kensho agree that any dispute or claim arising from or relating to the Terms shall be finally settled
    by final and binding arbitration, using the English language, administered by the American Arbitration Association (the
    “AAA”) under its Commercial Arbitration Rules then in effect (those rules are deemed to be incorporated by reference
    into this section, and as of the date of these Terms you can find them here or by calling the AAA at 1–800–778–7879).
    Arbitration will be handled by a sole arbitrator in accordance with those rules. Judgment on the arbitration award may
    be entered in any court that has jurisdiction. ANY ARBITRATION UNDER THE TERMS WILL TAKE PLACE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS--CLASS
    ARBITRATIONS AND CLASS ACTIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT BY AGREEING TO THE TERMS, YOU AND KENSHO ARE EACH
    WAIVING THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR CLASS ARBITRATION. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
    each party shall have the right to bring an action in a court of proper jurisdiction for injunctive or other equitable
    or conservatory relief, pending a final decision by the arbitrator. You may instead assert your claim in “small claims”
    court, but only if your claim qualifies, your claim remains in such court, and your claim remains on an individual, non-representative,
    and non-class basis.
    <br/>
    <br/> Costs of Arbitration. Payment for any and all reasonable AAA filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees will be in
    accordance with the Consumer Arbitration Rules.
    <br/>
    <br/> Forum. We’re based in Delaware, so any legal action against Kensho related to our Service must be filed and take place
    in the State of Delaware. That means the seat of any arbitration shall be in Delaware. For any actions not subject to
    arbitration, you and Kensho agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of a state court located in the State of Delaware.
    <br/>
    <br/> Government Exception. If you are a government agent or entity in the United States using the Service in your official
    capacity, and you are legally unable to agree to the clauses in this section, then those clauses do not apply to you.
    In that case, the Terms and any action related to the Terms will be governed by the laws of the United States (without
    reference to conflict of laws) and, in the absence of federal law and to the extent permitted under federal law, the
    laws of the State of Delaware.
    <br/>
    <br/> Modifications. If we make any changes to this “Disputes with Kensho” section after the date you last accepted the Terms,
    those changes will not apply to any claims filed in a legal proceeding against Kensho prior to the date the changes became
    effective. Kensho will notify you of substantive changes to the “Disputes with Kensho” section at least 30 days prior
    to the date the change will become effective. If you do not agree to the modified terms, you may send Kensho a written
    notification (including email) or close your account within those 30 days. By rejecting a modified term or permanently
    closing your account, you agree to arbitrate any disputes between you and Kensho in accordance with the provisions of
    this “Disputes with Kensho” section as of the date you last accepted the Terms, including any changes made prior to your
    rejection. If you reopen your closed account or create a new account, you agree to be bound by the current version of
    the Terms.
    <br/>
    <br/> 20. Changes to the Terms
    <br/>
    <br/> We may update these Terms from time to time. If we believe that the changes are material, we’ll definitely let you know
    by doing one (or more) of the following: (1) posting the changes through the Service or (2) sending you an email or message
    about the changes. That way you can decide whether you want to continue using the Service. Changes will be effective
    upon the posting of the changes. You are responsible for reviewing and becoming familiar with any changes. Your use of
    the Service following the changes constitutes your acceptance of the updated Terms.
    <br/>
    <br/> The following provisions survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement for any reason whatsoever: Liability,
    User Content, Disputes, Feedback, Attorney’s Fees, Intellectual Property, Indemnity, and Jurisdiction.
    <br/>
    <br/> 21. Copyright infringement
    <br/>
    <br/> If you believe any materials accessible on or from the Site infringe your copyright, you may request removal of those
    materials (or access thereto) from this web site by contacting Kensho at the address provided below  and providing the
    following information:

    include a copy or the location (e.g., URL) of an authorized version of the work.
    <br/>
    <br/> Identification of the material that you believe to be infringing and its location. Please describe the material, and
    provide us with its URL or any other pertinent information that will allow us to locate the material.
    <br/>
    <br/> Your name, address, telephone number and (if available) e-mail address.
    <br/>
    <br/> A statement that you have a good faith belief that the complained of use of the materials is not authorized by the copyright
    owner, its agent, or the law.
    <br/>
    <br/> A statement that the information that you have supplied is accurate, and indicating that "under penalty of perjury,"
    you are the copyright owner or are authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf.
    <br/>
    <br/> A signature or the electronic equivalent from the copyright holder or authorized representative.
    <br/>
    <br/> Our address for Copyright issues is as follows:
    <br/> help@kensho.com
    <br/>
    <br/> In an effort to protect the rights of copyright owners, Kensho maintains a policy for the termination, in appropriate
    circumstances, of subscribers and account holders of the Site who are repeat infringers.
    <br/>
    <br/> 22. General
    <br/>
    <br/> Waiver. No failure or delay by either party in exercising any right under the Terms, will constitute a waiver of that
    right. No waiver under the User Terms will be effective unless made in writing and signed by an authorized representative
    of the party being deemed to have granted the waiver.
    <br/>
    <br/> Disclaimer.  Each party acknowledges that it has not relied on any representation, warranty or statement made by any
    other party, other than as set out in this Agreement.
    <br/>
    <br/> Relationship.  The relationship of the parties to this Agreement does not form a joint venture or partnership.
    <br/>
    <br/> Waiver.  No clause of this Agreement will be deemed waived and no breach excused unless such waiver or consent is provided
    in writing.
    <br/>
    <br/> Further Assurances.  Each party must do anything necessary (including executing agreements and documents) to give full
    effect to this Agreement and the transaction facilitated by it.
    <br/>
    <br/> Severability.  Any clause of this Agreement, which is invalid or unenforceable is ineffective to the extent of the invalidity
    or unenforceability without affecting the remaining clauses of this Agreement.
    <br/>
    <br/> Entire Agreement. The Terms, including any terms incorporated by reference into the Terms, constitute the entire agreement
    between you and us and supersede all prior and contemporaneous agreements, proposals or representations, written or oral,
    concerning its subject matter. To the extent of any conflict or inconsistency between the provisions in these Terms and
    any pages referenced in these Terms, the terms of these Terms will prevail.
