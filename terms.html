    required to be physically delivered under law. You consent to receive electronic communications and you agree that all
    agreements, notices, disclosures and other communications that we provide to you electronically, via email and on the
    Site, satisfy any legal requirement that such communications be in writing.
    <br/>
    <br/> 19. Disputes
    <br/>
    <br/> If you’re upset with us, let us know, and hopefully we can resolve your issue. But if we can’t, then these rules will
    govern any legal dispute involving our Service:
    <br/>
    <br/> Governing Law. The Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to its conflict of laws rules,
    and the laws of the United States of America. These laws will apply no matter where in the world you live, but if you
    live outside of the United States, you may be entitled to the protection of the mandatory consumer protection provisions
    of your local consumer protection law.
    <br/>
    <br/> Arbitration. You and Kensho agree that any dispute or claim arising from or relating to the Terms shall be finally settled
    by final and binding arbitration, using the English language, administered by the American Arbitration Association (the
    “AAA”) under its Commercial Arbitration Rules then in effect (those rules are deemed to be incorporated by reference
    into this section, and as of the date of these Terms you can find them here or by calling the AAA at 1–800–778–7879).
    Arbitration will be handled by a sole arbitrator in accordance with those rules. Judgment on the arbitration award may
    be entered in any court that has jurisdiction. ANY ARBITRATION UNDER THE TERMS WILL TAKE PLACE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS--CLASS
    ARBITRATIONS AND CLASS ACTIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT BY AGREEING TO THE TERMS, YOU AND KENSHO ARE EACH
    WAIVING THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR CLASS ARBITRATION. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
    each party shall have the right to bring an action in a court of proper jurisdiction for injunctive or other equitable
    or conservatory relief, pending a final decision by the arbitrator. You may instead assert your claim in “small claims”
    court, but only if your claim qualifies, your claim remains in such court, and your claim remains on an individual, non-representative,
    and non-class basis.
    <br/>
    <br/> Costs of Arbitration. Payment for any and all reasonable AAA filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees will be in
    accordance with the Consumer Arbitration Rules.
    <br/>
    <br/> Forum. We’re based in Delaware, so any legal action against Kensho related to our Service must be filed and take place
    in the State of Delaware. That means the seat of any arbitration shall be in Delaware. For any actions not subject to
    arbitration, you and Kensho agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of a state court located in the State of Delaware.
    <br/>
    <br/> Government Exception. If you are a government agent or entity in the United States using the Service in your official
    capacity, and you are legally unable to agree to the clauses in this section, then those clauses do not apply to you.
    In that case, the Terms and any action related to the Terms will be governed by the laws of the United States (without
    reference to conflict of laws) and, in the absence of federal law and to the extent permitted under federal law, the
    laws of the State of Delaware.
    <br/>
    <br/> Modifications. If we make any changes to this “Disputes with Kensho” section after the date you last accepted the Terms,
    those changes will not apply to any claims filed in a legal proceeding against Kensho prior to the date the changes became
    effective. Kensho will notify you of substantive changes to the “Disputes with Kensho” section at least 30 days prior
    to the date the change will become effective. If you do not agree to the modified terms, you may send Kensho a written
    notification (including email) or close your account within those 30 days. By rejecting a modified term or permanently
    closing your account, you agree to arbitrate any disputes between you and Kensho in accordance with the provisions of
    this “Disputes with Kensho” section as of the date you last accepted the Terms, including any changes made prior to your
    rejection. If you reopen your closed account or create a new account, you agree to be bound by the current version of
    the Terms.
    <br/>
    <br/> 20. Changes to the Terms
    <br/>
    <br/> We may update these Terms from time to time. If we believe that the changes are material, we’ll definitely let you know
    by doing one (or more) of the following: (1) posting the changes through the Service or (2) sending you an email or message
    about the changes. That way you can decide whether you want to continue using the Service. Changes will be effective
    upon the posting of the changes. You are responsible for reviewing and becoming familiar with any changes. Your use of
    the Service following the changes constitutes your acceptance of the updated Terms.
    <br/>
    <br/> The following provisions survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement for any reason whatsoever: Liability,
    User Content, Disputes, Feedback, Attorney’s Fees, Intellectual Property, Indemnity, and Jurisdiction.
    <br/>
    <br/> 21. Copyright infringement

    <br/>
    <br/> 22. General
    <br/>
    <br/> Waiver. No failure or delay by either party in exercising any right under the Terms, will constitute a waiver of that
    right. No waiver under the User Terms will be effective unless made in writing and signed by an authorized representative

    or unenforceability without affecting the remaining clauses of this Agreement.
    <br/>
    <br/> Entire Agreement. The Terms, including any terms incorporated by reference into the Terms, constitute the entire agreement

      <br/>13	EXPORT
      <br/>13.1	Export laws and regulations of the United States and any other relevant local export laws and regulations apply to the services. You agree that such export control laws govern your use of the Service (including technical data) and any services deliverables provided under this agreement, and you agree to comply with all such export laws and regulations (including “deemed export” and “deemed re-export” regulations). You agree that no data, information, Service programs and/or materials resulting from services (or direct product thereof) will be exported, directly or indirectly, in violation of these laws, or will be used for any purpose prohibited by these laws including, without limitation, nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons proliferation, or development of missile technology.
      <br/>
      <br/>14	FORCE MAJEURE
      <br/>14.1	Neither party shall be responsible for failure or delay of performance if caused by: an act of war, hostility, or sabotage; act of God; electrical, internet, or telecommunication outage that is not caused by the obligated party; government restrictions (including the denial or cancellation of any export or other license); other event outside the reasonable control of the obligated party. Both parties will use reasonable efforts to mitigate the effect of a force majeure event. If such event continues for more than 30 days, either party may cancel unperformed services upon written notice. This section does not excuse either party’s obligation to take reasonable steps to follow its normal disaster recovery procedures or your obligation to pay for the services.
      <br/>
      <br/>15	DISPUTE RESOLUTION
      <br/>15.1	Governing Law. The Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to its conflict of laws rules, and the laws of the United States of America. These laws will apply no matter where in the world you live, but if you live outside of the United States, you may be entitled to the protection of the mandatory consumer protection provisions of your local consumer protection law.
      <br/>15.2	Arbitration. You and Kenshō agree that any dispute or claim arising from or relating to the Terms shall be finally settled by final and binding arbitration, using the English language, administered by the American Arbitration Association (the “AAA”) under its Commercial Arbitration Rules then in effect. Arbitration will be handled by a sole arbitrator in accordance with those rules. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court that has jurisdiction. Any arbitration under the Terms will take place on an individual basis--class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted. You understand that by agreeing to the Terms, you and Kenshō are each waiving the right to trial by jury or to participate in a class action or class arbitration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each party shall have the right to bring an action in a court of proper jurisdiction for injunctive or other equitable or conservatory relief, pending a final decision by the arbitrator. You may instead assert your claim in “small claims” court, but only if your claim qualifies, your claim remains in such court, and your claim remains on an individual, non-representative, and non-class basis.
      <br/>15.3	Costs of Arbitration. Payment for any and all reasonable AAA filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees will be in accordance with the Consumer Arbitration Rules.
      <br/>15.4	Forum. We’re based in Delaware, so any legal action against Kenshō related to our Services must be filed and take place in Delaware.. That means the seat of any arbitration shall be Delaware. For any actions not subject to arbitration, you and Kenshō agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of a state or federal court located in Delaware.
      <br/>15.5	Government Exception. If you are a government agent or entity in the United States using the Services in your official capacity, and you are legally unable to agree to the clauses in this section, then those clauses do not apply to you. In that case, the Terms and any action related to the Terms will be governed by the laws of the United States (without reference to conflict of laws) and, in the absence of federal law and to the extent permitted under federal law, the laws of the State of Delaware.
      <br/>15.6	Modifications. If we make any changes to this “Disputes with Kenshō” section after the date you last accepted the Terms, those changes will not apply to any claims filed in a legal proceeding against Kenshō prior to the date the changes became effective. Kenshō will notify you of substantive changes to the “Disputes with Kenshō” section at least 30 days prior to the date the change will become effective. If you do not agree to the modified terms, you may send Kenshō a written notification (including email) or close your account within those 30 days. By rejecting a modified term or permanently closing your account, you agree to arbitrate any disputes between you and Kenshō in accordance with the provisions of this “Disputes with Kenshō” section as of the date you last accepted the Terms, including any changes made prior to your rejection. If you reopen your closed account or create a new account, you agree to be bound by the current version of the Terms.
      <br/>
      <br/>16	ATTORNEYS’ FEES
      <br/>16.1	In the event that either Party breaches any portion of this Agreement, the prevailing Party in an action to enforce this Agreement may recover from the other its reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs, if employment of an attorney was necessary.
      <br/>
      <br/>17	NOTICES

      <br/>17.2	A consent, notice or communication under this Agreement is effective if it is sent as an electronic communication unless required to be physically delivered under law.
      <br/>
      <br/>18	STATISTICAL INFORMATION
      <br/>18.1	Company may compile statistical information related to the performance of the services, and may make such information publicly available, provided that such information does not incorporate your data and/or identify your confidential information or include your company’s name. Company retains all intellectual property rights in such information.
      <br/>
      <br/>19	THIRD PARTY WEBSITES
      <br/>19.1	The services may enable you to add links to Web sites and access to content, products and services of third parties, including users, advertisers, affiliates and sponsors of such third parties. Company is not responsible for any third party Web sites or third party content provided on or through the services and you bear all risks associated with the access and use of such Web sites and third party content, products and services.
      <br/>
      <br/>20	CUSTOMER REFERENCE
      <br/>20.1	You agree (i) that Company may identify you as a Provider of services and use your logo in sales presentations, marketing materials and press releases, and (ii) to develop a brief customer profile for use by Company for promotional purposes.
      <br/>
      <br/>21	GENERAL
      <br/>21.1	Formation. This Agreement is formed when the Provider acknowledges their consent to this Agreement, whether done electronically or physically.
      <br/>21.2	Entire Agreement. This agreement, including all schedules and Appendices constitutes the entire understanding and contract between the Parties and supersedes any and all prior and contemporaneous, oral or written representations, communications, understandings, and agreements between the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. The Parties acknowledge and agree that neither of the Parties is entering into this agreement on the basis of any representations or promises not expressly contained herein.
      <br/>21.3	Disclaimer.  Each party acknowledges that it has not relied on any representation, warranty or statement made by any other party, other than as set out in this Agreement.
      <br/>21.4	UITA. The Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act does not apply to this agreement. You understand that Company’s business partners, including any third party firms retained by you to provide computer consulting services, are independent of Company and are not Company’s agents. Company is not liable for nor bound by any acts of any such business partner, unless the business partner is providing services as an Company subcontractor on an engagement ordered under this Service as a service agreement.
      <br/>21.5	Relationship.  The relationship of the parties to this Agreement does not form a joint venture or partnership.
      <br/>21.6	Waiver.  No clause of this Agreement will be deemed waived and no breach excused unless such waiver or consent is provided in writing.
      <br/>21.7	Further Assurances.  Each party must do anything necessary (including executing agreements and documents) to give full effect to this Agreement and the transaction facilitated by it.
      <br/>21.8	Counterparts.  This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts.  All counterparts together will be taken to constitute one instrument.
      <br/>21.9	Severability.  Any clause of this Agreement, which is invalid or unenforceable is ineffective to the extent of the invalidity or unenforceability without affecting the remaining clauses of this Agreement.
